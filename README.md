# MKB4free

MKB4free is a web application that provides an image gallery of various wallpapers and allows users to download them in different formats and resolutions. It features responsive design, a search functionality, lazy loading, and a dropdown menu for selecting download options.

## Features

- **Responsive Design:** The gallery adapts to different screen sizes, displaying images in a grid that adjusts from mobile to desktop view.
- **Lazy Loading:** Initially, only 50 images are loaded. More images are loaded dynamically as the user scrolls down.
- **Search Functionality:** Users can search by artist name, image name, or quality format.
- **Image Download Options:** (currently not working) Each image has a dropdown menu with various formats (e.g., `wfs`, `dhd`, etc.) for download. The file is named dynamically based on the image name and format.
- **Smaller Image Display:** On mobile devices, the images and cards are displayed in a smaller format for better usability.
